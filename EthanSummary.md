### Team Project Summary for Ethan Martino
  Overall, I'd say the project workflow between collaborators went very smoothly. I think they only hurdle we went through was the initial 
planning. We had only a vague understanding of what we wanted our final project to be. So our main blocks were just not knowing what to do 
next, I think. Overall though, it was an enjoyable process. The flow of creating issues for each other and branches and things came very 
naturally to both of us, with little hickups along the way.

  My personal biggest obstacle was implmenting the many-to-many relationship between FoodItems and their ingredients(RawMaterials). This 
took up more of my time than anything, and I fear it isn't reflected in my work. I spent many hours trying to get it to work logically in 
my mind and I still feel the implementation isn't as complete as it could be. I also didn't get a chance to fully test it either, so I'm 
not very confident with what I ended up with. And I do feel that the large amound of time I spent on this one issue may have held our team 
back a little bit.

  All in all, I feel this project was good practice with working in teams with other people. I think for myself (and a lot of other 
programmers), working with others will probably be my biggest challenge to overcome while entering the industry.  
  
  While most of my actual coding was done in the beginning (around February), all of my researching and planning, along with trial and 
  error coding, happened towards the end of February and throughout March. 
* Between February 27 and March 5, I spent about 1.5 hours on the project, mainly fixing classes and planning what I was to do with the 
  FoodItem and RawMaterial relationship.
* Between March 6 and March 13, I spent about 3 hours on the project, mostly researching and trial and error.
* Between March 14 and March 18, I spent about 3 hours again, finishing up the many-to-many relationship and creating the initial logic 
  for the Point of Sale form.
